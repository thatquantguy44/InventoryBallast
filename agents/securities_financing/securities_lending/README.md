# Securities Lending Agent

## Purpose

The Securities Lending Agent handles stock loan and borrow: locating and pricing
the borrow that a short position requires, and the mechanics that determine its
cost and risk — general collateral vs specials, short rebate, recalls, buy-ins, and
corporate actions on loaned securities.

## Use When

- A short strategy needs borrow availability and cost assessed.
- Hard-to-borrow / specials rates need to be factored into a signal or backtest.
- Recall and buy-in risk on a short book need review.
- Corporate actions (dividends, votes) on loaned/borrowed stock need handling.

## Inputs

- The securities to borrow and the intended short size and horizon.
- Borrow availability and rate data (GC vs specials), point-in-time.
- Rebate/fee structure and any term-vs-open loan terms.
- Recall, buy-in, and corporate-action considerations.

## Outputs

- A borrow availability and cost assessment (fee, rebate, GC vs specials).
- Recall and buy-in risk characterization.
- Corporate-action handling (manufactured dividends, voting) on the loan.
- Point-in-time borrow-cost treatment for signals and backtests.
- Capacity implications from limited or expensive borrow.

## Example Requests

- "Assess borrow availability and cost for shorting this basket, point-in-time."
- "Factor hard-to-borrow rates and rebate into this short strategy's returns."
- "Review recall and buy-in risk for this short book."

## Required Review Themes

- Borrow cost (fee/rebate) netted from short returns; GC vs specials distinguished.
- Point-in-time borrow rates and hard-to-borrow status; no hindsight borrow cost.
- Recall and buy-in risk, and their effect on holding the short.
- Corporate actions on loaned stock (manufactured dividends, lost votes).
- Capacity limited by availability, especially in specials.

## Runtime

A tested, runnable lending-desk pipeline exists for the classification, inventory,
and risk mechanics this agent reviews (spec `0023-securities-lending-workflow`):
`src/quantsmith/quant/agentic_quant/sec_lending_workflow.py` — universe
construction → borrow-rate/GC-WARM-HTB classification → LP inventory
optimization (balance-sheet- and counterparty-capped) → concentration risk →
optional ML demand forecast/anomaly detection → report. Run it via
`quantsmith-sec-lending` or `python -m quantsmith.quant.agentic_quant`. This
agent's review themes (point-in-time borrow rates, recall/buy-in risk,
corporate actions) still require human judgment the runtime does not automate.
